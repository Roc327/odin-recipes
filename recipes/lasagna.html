        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat<br>
                is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes, <br>
                tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan <br>
                cheese into meat mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce for at least 1 hour (up to 6 for best flavor). Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; let soak for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg into egg until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of the <br>
                shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat layers twice more, ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. <br>
                Cover dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese topping is lightly browned, <br>
                10 to 15 more minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
