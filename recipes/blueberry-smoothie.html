        <h3>Chocolate blueberry protein shake</h3>
        <p>This is a protein shake I came up with after really cracking down on eating healthy and living fit.  Most mornings I would eat (drink?) this after a run for breakfast.  I first noticed and was plesently surprised at not just how tasty but how filling it was. Yes it has went through what feels like thousands of iterations but this is what I landed on as a default.</p>
        <p>This originated from a base smoothie I came up with, so subtracting the protein powder and other ingredients, you can break it down to just a base of: blueberries (I always use frozen in lieu of other smoothies using ice), kale, spinach and banana.  From there I usually always added cinnamon then sometimes cacao powder, maybe garlic and/or turmeric.  You can really play with the base from there adding and changing to your taste.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>140 grams Frozen blueberries</li>
            <li>42 grams Spinach greens</li>
            <li>42 grams Kale greens</li>
            <li>1 Banana</li>
            <li>1 scoop Chocolate protein powder (70% pea protein 30% brown rice protein)</li>
            <li>Cinnamon to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all ingredients into a blender, the order surprisingly seems to matter for taste purposes. My order is blueberries, spinach, kale, banana</li>
            <li>Now add the protein powder. I specifically use plant based protein because whey foams up</li>
            <li>Add the remaining powders for me just cinnamon</li>
            <li>Blend roughly 45 secs until smooth and well mixxed, I use a vitamix the ninja I used to have never fully chopped the veggies but it left texture.</li>
            <li>Pour into your favorite container and drink.</li>
        </ol>
